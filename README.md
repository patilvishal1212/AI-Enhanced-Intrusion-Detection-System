🛡 AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Real-Time Cyber Threat Detection Using Machine Learning
👨‍💻 Developed by: Vishal Patil

📌 Project Overview
In today’s hyper-connected digital world, ensuring the security of critical infrastructure and sensitive data has become more vital than ever. This project is a fully functional AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS) developed by Vishal Patil, which leverages machine learning to detect, classify, and respond to network-based cyber threats in real time.

The system integrates Random Forest Classification, SMOTE-based data balancing, and a responsive web interface built with Flask — forming a powerful, intelligent IDS for modern organizational security.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.10+ – Core programming language

Flask – Lightweight Python web framework

HTML / CSS – For frontend user interface

Pandas / NumPy – Data preprocessing and manipulation

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning framework

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE) – To balance the dataset

Joblib – Model saving and loading

🧠 Machine Learning Model Details
The AI model used is a Random Forest Classifier, trained on a well-labeled and balanced network intrusion dataset. Using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), the dataset is adjusted to address class imbalance.

The trained model is saved as:
